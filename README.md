This is a fun game where you sacrifice souls to progress forwards.

For this game we used Krita, Godot, and a bit of chatGPT,
Only the background image and some refrences (Help for code) were taken from chatGPT

While making this project we faced many challenges, since we had resolved to not using AI for anything.
This was a fun experience and we all that is 
Mukund, Nakshatra, and Dishita
Learned a lot today!!!
